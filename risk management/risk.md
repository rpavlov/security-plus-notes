# Risk management

These notes are from the Stackskills course.

## Asset evaluation

Delphi technique is used to evaluate information assets. Needs
expert opinions + surveys by them.

Asset value = $100. Tangible and non-tangible.
Exposure factor = .3.
Loss = 30% of asset values.
SLE (single loss expectancy) =  AV * EF = $30
ARO (annual rate occurancy) = 1/n where n is the number of times per year. Say 0.3.
ALE (annual loss expectancy) = SLE * ARO = $9

So, don't spend more than $9 for this particular risk. It's about cost-effectiveness.

Areas of vulnerability: physical, electrical, software, personnel.

Risk types: natural (fire), man-made (intentional: arson, theft), unintentional: (employee mistakes)

Risk probabiltiy and prioritization:

1. Perform risk analysis
2. List risks identified
3. Determine probability
4. Prioritize risks

Quantitative risk analysis: Estimate based on number of occurances
Qualititative: best guess estimate by expert.

Safeguard selection criteria: cost effectiveness, risk reduction and practicality.

## Vulnerability assesment tools

Nessus is the main one. nmap or zmap is good for mapping the network too.

Vulnerability vs exploit: former is a weakness, an exploit is a tool that can be used to exploit the vulnerability.
