# Misc notes

* Most commonly occuring classes of vulns are lack of security headers, XSS and SSRF.
    * Write a blog post outlining the new best practices for security headers.
* I should focus on the Network+ cert next.
* An application security program is composed of:
    1. Asset inventory.
    2. Education and awareness.
    3. Penetration testing and vulnerability assessments.
    4. DAST.
    5. SAST & SCA (Software composition analysis aka vulns in 3rd party libraries)
    6. WAF & RASP
    7. IAST
    8. Threat modeling.
    9. Centralized Vulnerability Management (?)
    10. Low level fuzzing
    11. Appsec pipeline
    12. Continuous / Real-time testing.
