# Information security lifecycle

Information is an asset, and separate from physical assets. Arguably more valuable.

Technical security does not by itself protect against fraud. Administrative security covers unauthorized access to data.

Security is 3 parts: Technical security (passwords and such), Administrative security (policies and procedures) and finally physical security.

What does it mean to be secure? CIA: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.

C: username/password. For ensuring the right people only have access.
I: mitm attacks, information is visible and manipulatable.
A: ddos, destroying data etc. Clustering, backups provide availability.

For example, encryption provides both C and I.

There should be multiple layers of security: Prevention, Detection and Recovery.

These are synonamous with controls.
