# Network security

### IDS

3 layers: preventive, detective, corrective.

IDS: intrusion detection system.
IPS: intrusion prevention system.

Snort is one of the major IDS. Firewallis is preventive, by contrast.

IDS are either signature based or behaviour based. Behaviour based needs to run, build a baseline or heuristic and alert based on that. Lot of false positives and if its compromised to begin with are problematic.

IDS are either network based or host based. The later is used from event viewer or logs, whereas network is based on real traffic.
